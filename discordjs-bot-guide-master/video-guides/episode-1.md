Welcome to the first episode of my guide which will help you create a Discord Bot using the amazing Discord.js library, and I hope you follow along and create your very own bot!

If I got anything wrong in this episode, please keep it to yourself LOL, ignorance is bliss, nah I'm kidding, let me know what I got wrong and I'll correct it in the next episode.

Please let me know what you think to the series, and suggest things for me to cover in future episodes, I have a mental road map I will be following, but I may throw in the odd episode dedicated to requests.
