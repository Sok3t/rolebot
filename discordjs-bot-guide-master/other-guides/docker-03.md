Welcome back to the Docker new mini-series, where I show you how to use Docker, in this episode I go through the steps of creating the project and getting it ready for the Dockerfile.

Please let me know what you think to the mini-series, if you want to see more of this stuff, please post in the comments below!

Commands used in this episode;

`mkdir my-discord-bot && cd my-discord-bot/` - This will create the folder for the project and enter in to it.

`touch index.js && npm init --yes` - This creates a file called `index.js` and initializes the project using NPM.

`npm install hydrabolt/discord.js` --save - This installs the later master branch of discord.js which is recommended.

`touch settings.json` - This creates a configuration file that stores our bot's token.
